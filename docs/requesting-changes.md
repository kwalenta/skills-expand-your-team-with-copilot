# Quick Reference: Requesting Changes

## For Teachers and Non-Technical Users

Don't know how to code? No problem! We've created simple forms to help you request changes to the Mergington High School Activities application.

### 🎯 Quick Template Selector

| I want to... | Use this template | Example |
|--------------|------------------|---------|
| Add new functionality | 🚀 **Feature Enhancement** | Add calendar view, waitlist system |
| Change how it looks | 🎨 **UI/UX Improvement** | Dark mode, better mobile layout |
| Report something broken | 🐛 **Bug Report** | Registration not working, search broken |
| Update colors/text/images | 📝 **Content & Styling** | School colors, mascot, contact info |
| Fix slow/technical issues | ⚡ **Performance & Technical** | Slow loading, mobile problems |
| Manage activities/data | 📊 **Activity & Data Management** | Add activities, teacher login |

### 📝 How to Request Changes

1. **[Click here to create a new issue](../../issues/new/choose)**
2. **Choose the template** that matches what you need
3. **Fill out the form** - be as specific as possible
4. **Submit** - your request will be reviewed and implemented

### ✨ What Makes a Good Request

**Be Specific**: Instead of "make it prettier" → "change blue colors to lime green (#32CD32)"

**Include Examples**: Reference other websites, attach screenshots, or describe exactly what you want

**Define Success**: What does "done" look like? How will you know the request is complete?

**Consider Users**: How will this change help students, teachers, or administrators?

### 🚀 Getting Started

**New to GitHub Issues?** No worries! The templates guide you through everything step by step.

**Not sure which template to use?** Start with your best guess - we can always clarify later.

**Need inspiration?** Look at these example requests:

- [Add Dark Mode Toggle](../steps/1-step-issues/enhancement/3.2-dark-mode.md)
- [Fix School Colors](../steps/1-step-issues/bug/school-pride.md)  
- [Add Calendar View](../steps/1-step-issues/enhancement/4.1-calendar-view.md)

### 📞 Need Help?

- **Stuck on a form?** Ask a tech-savvy colleague to help
- **Not sure what to ask for?** Describe the problem you're trying to solve
- **Want to see examples?** Check the `/steps/1-step-issues/` folder for sample requests

Remember: The goal is to gather enough information so a Copilot coding agent can implement your request without needing to ask follow-up questions. When in doubt, include more detail rather than less!
